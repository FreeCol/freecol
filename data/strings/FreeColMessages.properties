colopedia.concepts.taxes.name=Taxes
colopedia.concepts.taxes.description=<html><p>Early in the game, the Monarch does not levy any taxes on your income. Over time, however, the Monarch will be sure to increase sales taxes for a number of reasons that you may find more or less convincing. Every time the Monarch proposes to increase taxes, you may refuse. In that case, a particular type of goods will be boycotted, which means that you will no longer be able to buy or sell that type of goods in Europe, and up to one hundred items of that type of goods will be destroyed by enraged colonists in one of your colonies.</p><p>Boycotts can be lifted by paying your tax arrears (a costly business), or by the election of <a href="http:///id/model.foundingFather.jacobFugger">Jacob Fugger</a> to the Continental Congress.</p></html>
colopedia.concepts.efficiency.name=Efficiency
colopedia.concepts.efficiency.description=<html><p>The efficiency of your colonies depends on their support for the idea of independence. If 50 percent of the colonists favour the rebel cause, the colony is granted a +1 production bonus. As soon as 100 percent of the colonists become rebels, the production bonus increases to +2.</p><p>On the other hand, if the number of royalists exceeds the <i>bad government limit</i>, the colony incurs a production penalty of -1. Should the number of royalists exceed the <i>very bad government limit</i>, the production penalty is increased to -2. These two limits depend on the difficulty level and can be checked in the <a href="http:///action/difficultyAction">difficulty level report</a>.</p><p>In order to increase the efficiency of a colony, you need to reduce its population, or produce more <a href="http:///id/model.goods.bells">liberty bells</a>.</p></html>
colopedia.concepts.education.name=Education
colopedia.concepts.education.description=<html><p>The most efficient way to educate your colonists is to build a <a href="http:///id/model.building.school">school</a> and assign an expert unit as a teacher. The teacher will then turn a <a href="http:///id/model.unit.freeColonist">free colonist</a> into an expert of the same type. Teachers are also able to upgrade <a href="http:///id/model.unit.pettyCriminal">petty criminals</a> to <a href="http:///id/model.unit.indenturedServant">indentured servants</a>, and indentured servants to free colonists.</p><p>Some skills can also be learned from the natives, by sending a free colonist or indentured servant to live in a native settlement for a turn. And some skills can also be learned by experience, by putting a free colonist to work a colony tile. Free colonists working in the fields and forests surrounding your colonies accumulate up to 200 points of experience, which amounts to a four percent chance of being upgraded.</p></html>
colopedia.concepts.independence.name=Independence
colopedia.concepts.independence.description=<html><p>You start the game as an explorer with a handful of units at your disposal. The Monarch expects you to establish a colony in the New World and to bring treasures and exotic goods to your Home Port. You, however, have different plans: you wish to establish an independent nation.</p><p>In order to declare independence, you need to convince at least 50% of the population of your colonies. You can do this by producing <a href="http:///id/model.goods.bells">liberty bells</a>, which also increase the <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.efficiency">efficiency</a> of your colonies.</p><p>As you can imagine, the Monarch will not just let you go. After declaring independence, you will have to fight and destroy the <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.ref">Royal Expeditionary Force</a> (REF). If the REF ever controls all your coastal colonies, or at least 90% of your population, your bid for independence will fail.</p></html>
colopedia.concepts.ref.name=Royal Expeditionary Force
colopedia.concepts.ref.description=<html><p>The Monarch knows better than to trust a bunch of rag-tag conquistadors and religious malcontents unwilling to pay taxes and to bow to the fair demands of the Crown. For this reason, the Monarch keeps a special <i>Royal Expeditionary Force</i> (REF) ready to quell any attempts to declare <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.independence">independence</a> and to secede from the home country.</p><p>The <i>Royal Expeditionary Force</i> is partially balanced by the <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.interventionForce">Intervention Force</a>, which will be dispatched by a foreign power sympathetic to your cause, provided you can produce a sufficient number of <a href="http:///id/model.goods.bells">liberty bells</a>. From time to time, further units will be added to both the <i>Royal Expeditionary Force</i> and the <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.interventionForce">Intervention Force</a>.</p></html>
colopedia.concepts.interventionForce.name=Intervention Force
colopedia.concepts.interventionForce.description=<html><p>Any attempt of your colonies to declare <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.independence">independence</a> will inevitably weaken your home country. This is in the interest of your home country's enemies. For this reason, one of them will dispatch an <i>Intervention Force</i> to support you against the <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.ref">Royal Expeditionary Force</a> in the <i>War of Independence</i>, provided you can produce a sufficient number of <a href="http:///id/model.goods.bells">liberty bells</a>.</p><p>Over the course of the game, both the <i>Intervention Force</i> and the <a href="http:///id/colopedia.concepts.ref">Royal Expeditionary Force</a> will be reinforced with further units.</p></html>

# Native names
# BUG: These have been chosen on the basis of what could be found with
# google in one afternoon. We need someone who actually knows
# something about native American culture to sort things out.
# In each case I have tried to pick a prominent place for a capital,
# and ordered the rest in the following categories:
#   prominent settlements
#   settlements
#   place names
#   names in the language
#   words in the language.
# The code chooses randomly from the list (apart from the capital),
# but this should cease once the list is expertly edited and arranged
# in a sensible order.

# Apache
# Hard to find place names, and the Apache languages are tonal so the
# transliteration was particularly brutal. The following are just
# names, often of tribes, not place names. The capital is the name of
# a tribe and a prosperous reservation.
