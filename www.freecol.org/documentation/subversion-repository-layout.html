                            <p>At the top-most level of the repository we have the following directories:</p>

                                    <td>The source files for the graphics are contained within this directory. We also keep certain rendered images as well - especially if the images are currently not in use.</td>

                                Each of these directories have their own <i>trunk</i>, <i>tags</i> and <i>branches</i> directories. The <i>trunk</i> contains the main version, while the <i>tags</i> depicts how a version appears at a release and <i>branches</i> contains alternate directions of development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currently the tags and branches directories are only used for the freecol part of the repository.
                            </p>
                            <br />

                                We are developing two versions of FreeCol at the same time: the <a href="http://freecol.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freecol/freecol/trunk" alt="View Main version">main version</a> and a <a href="http://freecol.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freecol/freecol/branches">stable branch</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img src="../images/releases.png" alt="BRANCHES" border="0" style="max-width: 100%;" />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We use the stable branch only for bugfix releases while new features are placed in the main version. When fixing bugs we add the changes both to the stable branch and the main version.
