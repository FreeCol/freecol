                                <A name="about"></A>FreeCol evolved from a pure C/C++ project into a pure Java project.
                                The first official release of FreeCol was, however, already using Java for the client.
                                FreeCol has been fully Java-based since early 2003.

                                The game has been developed incrementally without any formal design document. Developers
                                have been working on the features they have chosen for themselves, but major changes
                                have been discussed on the mailing lists first. Naturally, the discussions on the
                                mailing lists have been exceedingly important in order to coordinate our efforts in a
                                common direction.

                                The graph above depicts the number of lines of code from the start of the project and
                                until some time beyond the release of version 0.7.3. Notice the period of time spent on
                                the first major restructuring of the codebase. We are currently restructuring the
                                codebase for the second time. This time we are working towards making the game more
                                modifiable.

                                            The code had been redesigned and restructured in order to make the ongoing

                                            originally having been seperated in client and server implementations
                                            programmed in Java and C++ respectively. New features were added more
                                            frequently after the restructuring, as evident by the Lines of Code graph
                                            displayed on this page.

                                            and win a multiplayer game. Several new features were added - such as colonies,
