/**
 * Represents the style of a tile improvement, such as a river or
 * road. Since TileImprovementStyles are immutable and some styles are
 * far more common than others (e.g. rivers with two branches are far
 * more common than rivers with a single branch, or three or four
 * branches), the class caches all styles actually used.
 *
 * As of 0.10.6 we use:
 *   - Four character encoded strings for rivers: a "0" for no connection,
 *     otherwise the string value of the integer magnitude of the river
 *     for each of Direction.longSides.
 *   - Eight character binary encoded strings for roads: a "0" or "1" for
 *     each of Direction.values()
 *   These are distinct so that the overlays can vary.
