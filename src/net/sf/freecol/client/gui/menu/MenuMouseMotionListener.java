 * This class is meant to make the autoscrolling work better, so that
 * you don't have to hover the mouse exactly one pixel below the menu
 * bar to make it scroll up.  This is the MouseMotionListener added to
 * the menu bar, allowing you to scroll by just moving the mouse all
 * the way to the top of the screen.
 * 
 * Note: This doesn't cause it to scroll down when you reach the
 * bottom of the menu bar, because the performAutoScrollIfActive will
 * compare the Y coordinate to the size of the entire canvas (which
 * should always be bigger).
