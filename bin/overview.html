<br>This is the javadoc generated code documentation for FreeCol.
<p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
The {@link net.sf.freecol main package} contains the class 
{@link net.sf.freecol.FreeCol} which is responsible for handling 
the command-line arguments and starting either 
a stand-alone server or a client-GUI.
<p>
The rest of the program has been divided into three separate packages:
{@link net.sf.freecol.client client},
{@link net.sf.freecol.common common} and
{@link net.sf.freecol.server server}.
<p>
You might have noticed a fourth package named
{@link net.sf.freecol.metaserver metaserver}, but this is a separate
program. The metaserver is running on <code>meta.freecol.org:3540</code> 
in order to maintain a central list of public servers. 

<br>&nbsp;
<h4>Client/server-architecture</h4>
We use a client/server-architecture. That is: a group of clients connects 
to the server in order to play a game. We are also using this approach 
even when a singleplayer game has been chosen (then there is only one 
client connected to the server).
<p>
The client and the server are really two different programs, even though 
it is possible to start the server from the client GUI, and all interaction 
between the client and the server, after the creation of the server, 
should be done by communicating through the network.
<p>
Both the clients and the server has a game model, but only the server has 
the complete game model containing all the information. The client model 
only contains the information being visible to the player using the client.
<p>
One important point here is: You will need to update all the clients' models 
as well as the server model if you want perform an action (like building 
a colony, moving a unit etc).

<h4>The game model</h4>
The <code>common</code> package contains everything being shared between 
the client and the server. One of these things is the 
{@link net.sf.freecol.common.model game model} which is best described as 
being a model of the imaginary world we are creating. 
<p>
The model should only contain the information needed to model the imaginary world. 
That is; it should not contain information on how the map should be displayed etc.
